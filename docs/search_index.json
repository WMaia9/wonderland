Recently many people are looking for this type of insurance and prices can vary widely according to the users data. The main question of this analysis is to answer the final price that users need to pay. Data sources: insurance.csv was provided by Kaggle.com: Medical Cost Personal Datasets 2.1.1 Project Goals In this project will be make a case study using the linear regression method on Medical Insurance Costs dataset provided by the kaggle 2.1.2 Data The project has one data set provided by Kaggle called insurance.csv. In the data, each row represents an user and the columns are the responses to their user profiles which include data about them. 2.1.3 Analysis This solution will use descriptive statistics and data visualization to find key figures in understanding the distribution, count, and relationship between variables. 2.1.4 Evaluation The project will conclude with the evaluation of linear model. A simple case study will be done for one variable and then for multiple variables. After that will be focus on visualizing the adjusted models than will be look at the residual plots and the error band.

In recent years, there has been a massive rise in the usage of dating apps to find love. Many of these apps use sophisticated data science techniques to recommend possible matches to users and to optimize the user experience. These apps give us access to a wealth of information that weve never had before about how different people experience romance. Data sources: okcupid_profiles.csv was provided by Kaggle.com: OkCupid Profiles 3.1.1 Project Goals In this project, the goal is to analyze the data from Kaggle using tools of Data Science. The primary research question that will be answered is whether an OkCupids user astrological sign can be predicted using other variables from their profiles. 3.1.2 Data The project has one data set provided by Kaggle called okcupid_profiles.csv. In the data, each row represents an OkCupid user and the columns are the responses to their user profiles which include multi-choice and short answer questions. 3.1.3 Analysis This solution uses descriptive statistics and data visualization to find key figures in understanding the distribution, count, and relationship between variables. Since the goal of the project is to make predictions on the users astrological signs, classification algorithms from the supervised learning family of machine learning models are implemented. 3.1.4 Evaluation The project concludes with the evaluation of the machine learning model selected with a validation data set. The output of the predictions can be checked through a confusion matrix, and metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 and Kappa scores. 3.2 Knowing the Data To analyze the user profiles from OkCupid, pandas will be used to load the dataset into a DataFrame so that it can be explored and visualized with Python. 3.2.0.1 Data Characteristics profiles has 59,946 rows and 31 columns, this is a good sign since there seems to be enough data for machine learning. The columns in the dataset include: age: continuous variable of age of user body_type: categorical variable of body type of user diet: categorical variable of dietary information drinks: categorical variable of alcohol consumption drugs: categorical variable of drug usage education: categorical variable of educational attainment ethnicity: categorical variable of ethnic backgrounds height: continuous variable of height of user income: continuous variable of income of user job: categorical variable of employment description offspring: categorical variable of children status orientation: categorical variable of sexual orientation pets: categorical variable of pet preferences religion: categorical variable of religious background sex: categorical variable of gender sign: categorical variable of astrological symbol smokes: categorical variable of smoking consumption speaks: categorical variable of language spoken status: categorical variable of relationship status last_online: date variable of last login location: categorical variable of user locations And a set of open short-answer responses to : essay0: My self summary essay1: What Im doing with my life essay2: Im really good at essay3: The first thing people usually notice about me essay4: Favorite books, movies, show, music, and food essay5: The six things I could never do without essay6: I spend a lot of time thinking about essay7: On a typical Friday night I am essay8: The most private thing I am willing to admit essay9: You should message me if 3.3 Explore the Data First to be explored is the number of unique signs, and the values. It seems that there are 48, but there should only be 12 signs. Upon closer inspection, there seems to be qualifiers attached with the signs. 3.3.1 Continuous Variables 3.3.1.1 age The next plot shows the distribution of age in the group. It seems that most users are in their late 20s to early 30s. fig1 Here is the same chart but broken down by gender. It seems that there are proportionally similar breaks of gender by age, but slightly fewer females overall. fig 2 3.3.1.2 Height The next plot shows the height variable. most people look like they are between 1.5 and 2 meters tall. fig 3 Here is the same height chart showing the breakdown by gender. It seems obvious, but females tend to be shorter than males and look to have a normal distribution. 3.3.1.3 Income Here is the data of income, it seems that the majority of the participants do not include their income figures. fig 4 3.3.2 Discrete Variables 3.3.2.1 Sex Previously it was identified that there are more males in the data, and it seems that there are ~35,000 men to ~25,000 women. fig 5 3.3.2.2 Body Type The next chart shows the body type variable, and it seems that most users will describe themselves as average, fit, or athletic. fig 6 The next chart shows the breakdown of body type by gender and it seems that some of the body type descriptions are highly gendered. For example curvy and full figured are highly female descriptions, while males use a little extra, and overweight more often. fig 7 3.3.2.3 Diet Here is a chart of the dietary information for users. Most users eat mostly anything, followed by anything, and strictly anything, being open-minded seems to be a popular signal to potential partners. fig 8 3.3.2.4 Drinks The next plot shows that the majority of the users drink socially, then rarely and often. fig 9 3.3.2.5 Drugs The vast majority of users never use drugs. fig 10 3.3.2.6 Smoking Similarly for drugs the majority of users chose no for smoking. fig 11 3.3.2.7 Education Below you can see the majority of users are graduates from college/university followed by masters programs and those working on college/university. Interestingly space camp related options are fairly popular options. fig 12 3.3.2.8 Jobs Most users dont fit into the categories provided, but there are a fair share of students, artists, tech, and business folks. fig 13 3.3.2.9 Offspring The data suggest that most users do not have kids. fig 14 3.3.2.10 Orientation The majority of users are straight. fig 15 3.3.2.11 Pets The chart shows that most users like or have dogs. fig 16 3.3.2.12 Religion Religion was similar to sign where there are a lot of qualifiers. religion was cleaned to take the first word and distilled down to 9 groups. The majority was not very religious identifying as agnostic, other, or atheists. fig 17 3.3.2.13 Signs Here are the astrological signs of the users. They are mainly evenly distributed with Capricorns being the rarest and Leos being the most common. fig 18 3.3.2.14 Status The relationship status for a dating website is fairly predictable. One would assume that most people are single and available which is reflected in the data. fig 19 3.3.3 Data Preparation 3.3.3.1 Missing Data Missing data is often not handled by machine learning algorithms well and have to be checked so they may need to be imputed or removed. It seems that many of the columns do have missing values. "]]
