# Introduction {.unnumbered}

The demand for skilled data science practitioners in industry, academia, and the government is rapidly growing. This portfolio introduces concepts and skills that can help it tackle real-world data analysis challenges. It covers probability, statistical inference, linear regression, and machine learning concepts.

## Case studies {.unnumbered}

Throughout the portfolio, we use motivating case studies. We try to realistically mimic a data scientist's experience in each case study. We start by asking specific questions and answering these through data analysis for each of the concepts covered. We learn the ideas as a means to answer the questions. Case studies included in the portfolio are:

| **Case Study**                         | **Concept**                                                |

# About Me {#author .unnumbered}

About Me
I am a Master’s student in Mathematics, Statistics, and Computing at the University of São Paulo, advised by Sergio A. David. My research focuses on applying machine learning techniques to solve complex problems in natural language processing, and computational linguistics.

With a strong background in Data Science and Machine Learning, I have contributed to several projects involving the application of deep learning and natural language processing (NLP) models to solve real-world problems. Currently, I am working at Hand Talk, the world’s largest platform for automatic translation in Sign Languages, where I lead efforts to enhance accessibility through AI-driven solutions.

On this page, you will find some of the projects I am currently working on. You can see my Linkedin. [Here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wesley-maia-62009612a/).\
