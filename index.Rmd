# Introduction {.unnumbered}

The demand for skilled data science practitioners in industry, academia, and the government is rapidly growing. This portfolio introduces concepts and skills that can help it tackle real-world data analysis challenges. It covers probability, statistical inference, linear regression, and machine learning concepts.

## Case studies {.unnumbered}

Throughout the portfolio, we use motivating case studies. We try to realistically mimic a data scientist's experience in each case study. We start by asking specific questions and answering these through data analysis for each of the concepts covered. We learn the ideas as a means to answer the questions. Case studies included in the portfolio are:

| **Case Study**                         | **Concept**                                                |
